# Showing that clocks still tick while sync is enabled, and re-enabling oscillators (sync=0) doesn't actually quite
# mean everything is perfectly in sync.
# Experiments have shown that the oscillators can be out of sync by as much as the difference in clock divisors for the octave counters
# i.e. between 2 clocks and 256 clocks out of sync.
# This is (worst case) about 1.5 samples at 44.1kHz
