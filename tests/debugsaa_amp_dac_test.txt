# This is the "amp behavious like a primitive DAC" mode
# Env generator enabled, channel 2 unmuted, but osc mixer and noise mixer both disabled - the "shape of the envelope" becomes audible on its own
# The amplitude pdm is also applied (before the envelope pdm).
# So if you set envelope controller to "max volume envelope" shape, you can "hear" just the output level being controlled by the amplitude controller
# which means you can directly control the output level (3 bits) without any squarewave/carrier/etc
# (although you still get amplitude chopping at 8mhz)
